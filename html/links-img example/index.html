<!-- To create a link - a hyperlink to another page - we use the tag <a>. The link may have the following attributes:

href - where the link leads to (if it is going to be an external page, we have to use * http (s): // *. Otherwise, it will be a link to one of the pages of the same websites)
title - the link title (visible in the "balloon" after hovering over the cursor)
target - how the link should be opened (* _blank * - new tab)
Moreover, like any other element, it can have the following attributes:

id - the id element for CSS and JS purposes (there cannot be two elements with the same id on one page)
class - the class element for CSS and JS purposes
style - CSS style for this element only
... and many others -->
